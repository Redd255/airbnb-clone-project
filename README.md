# üè† Airbnb Clone Project

## üìå Project Overview

This project is a backend simulation of a scalable booking platform like Airbnb. The goal is to implement core backend features such as user management, property listings, bookings, payments, and reviews using modern tools and development practices.

### üéØ Project Goals

- Implement secure user authentication and profile management.
- Build property listing creation, update, and retrieval features.
- Allow users to book properties and manage booking details.
- Handle payment transactions securely.
- Enable guests to leave reviews and ratings.
- Use database optimization techniques for performance.
- Automate testing and deployment using CI/CD pipelines.

## üõ† Technology Stack

- **Django**: High-level Python web framework for building the backend and RESTful APIs.
- **PostgreSQL**: Relational database used to store structured data like users, bookings, and payments.
- **GraphQL**: Enables efficient and flexible data retrieval for clients needing specific fields.
- **Docker**: Used to containerize the application for consistent development, testing, and deployment environments.
- **GitHub Actions**: Provides CI/CD automation for code testing and deployment workflows.

Each technology contributes to building a secure, scalable, and maintainable backend system suitable for production.

## ‚ú® Feature Breakdown

### User Management
Users can register, log in, and manage profiles. Role-based access allows different functionality for guests and hosts.

### Property Management
Hosts can create, update, and delete property listings. All users can browse available properties.

### Booking System
Guests can view availability and make bookings for properties. Users can manage their booking history.

### Payment Processing
Secure transactions are recorded and tied to bookings. Payments include confirmation and status tracking.

### Review System
Guests can leave ratings and comments after stays, which are visible to future guests.

## üîê API Security

### Key Security Measures

- **Authentication**: Login and session management to verify user identity.
- **Authorization**: Only authorized users can edit their data or perform actions like creating a listing.
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents excessive API usage or brute-force attacks.
- **Input Validation**: Protects against SQL injection, XSS, and malformed inputs.
- **Encryption (HTTPS)**: All communication is encrypted to protect sensitive data.

### Why It‚Äôs Crucial

Security measures are essential to protect user data, financial transactions, and ensure platform integrity and trustworthiness.

## üîÑ CI/CD Pipeline

### What is CI/CD?

CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment. It automates code testing, building, and deployment, reducing human error and increasing development speed.

### Benefits of CI/CD

- Faster and more reliable deployments.
- Automated testing ensures high code quality.
- Immediate feedback helps fix bugs early.

### Tools Used

- **GitHub Actions**: Automates testing and deployment on every push or pull request.
- **Docker**: Ensures consistent application behavior across development and production.
